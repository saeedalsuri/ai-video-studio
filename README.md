# 🎬 AI Video Studio: Director's Console (v12.4)

### A Browser-Based Tool for Cinematic Control in Generative Video
**Designed to fix Historical Bias, Camera Hallucinations, and Sequence Continuity in tools like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, and Kling.**

---

## 🛑 The Problem
Most AI video generators default to "Hollywood Fantasy" tropes.
* Ask for a **Mamluk**, and you get a generic European knight.
* Ask for a **Falcon Dive**, and you get a static bird hovering in place.
* Ask for a **Massive Army**, and you get 5 guys in a field.

## ✅ The Solution
I designed this tool to act as a **cinematographer's interface** for prompting. It forces the AI to respect:
1.  **Historical Authenticity:** Specific dropdowns for Ethnicity (Turkic/Circassian), Costume (Lamellar/Chainmail), and Props.
2.  **Camera Physics:** Real-world camera terms like "Snorricam," "Russian Arm Tracking," and "Anamorphic Lens."
3.  **Dynamic Sequencing:** A specialized logic engine to handle complex transitions (e.g., "Sky to Ground" reveals).

## 🌟 Key Features
* **The "Falcon Engine":** A dedicated mode for prompting high-velocity aerial chases and dives.
* **Vector Control:** Force the camera to fly "Forward," "Down," or "Swoop" instead of random drifting.
* **Continuity Savers:** Auto-saves your work locally so you never lose a prompt during a crash.
* **Visual Logic:** Split into three production stages: **World Building**, **Cinematography**, and **Sequencing**.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  **Download:** Click the green "Code" button and download the ZIP (or just copy the `index.html` file).
2.  **Run:** Double-click `index.html`. It runs entirely in your browser. No installation or internet required.
3.  **Direct:**
    * Use **Tab 1** to set the Era and Atmosphere.
    * Use **Tab 2** to set the Camera Lens and Rig.
    * Use **Tab 3** to build complex movement sequences.

## 🤝 Contributing
I am a filmmaker/creator, not a professional coder. This tool was built using **Gemini 1.5** to execute the code based on my production workflows.

I invite developers to fork this repo and add:
* [ ] Export to PDF/CSV feature.
* [ ] Direct API integration with Runway/Luma.
* [ ] A "Save Preset" library.
